Hey [Supervisor's First Name],

So, I did that number-crunchy report thing for the quarter or whatever. Can you give it a once-over? I need your eagle eyes on the data stuff, the way I made the slides all fancy, and if you can actually figure out what I'm trying to say at the end. No biggie, just hit me back with your thoughts whenever.

Thanks a mil,
