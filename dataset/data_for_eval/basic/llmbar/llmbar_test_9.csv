Germany would have sought to exploit these resources through colonization, forced labor, and the establishment of slave labor camps.

This would involve the occupation and annexation of large parts of Russia, including the fertile farmlands of the Ukraine and the industrial regions of the Donbas.

4. Economic domination: Hitler sought to dominate the Russian economy and use it as a means to exploit the country's resources and industries.

1. Resource exploitation: Hitler believed that Russia was rich in natural resources, such as oil, gas, coal, and minerals, which Germany needed to fuel its war machine and industrialize its economy. Germany would have sought to exploit these resources through colonization, forced labor, and the establishment of slave labor camps.
2. Territorial expansion: Hitler aimed to establish a vast ""living space"" (Lebensraum) for the German people in Eastern Europe, including Russia. This would involve the occupation and annexation of large parts of Russia, including the fertile farmlands of the Ukraine and the industrial regions of the Donbas.
3. Racial purity: Hitler believed that the Russian people were racially inferior to the Germans and saw them as a threat to the purity of the German race. He intended to eliminate the ""inferior"" races and establish a German-dominated empire in Eastern Europe.
4. Economic domination: Hitler sought to dominate the Russian economy and use it as a means to exploit the country's resources and industries.

",Hitler wanted to turn Russia into a giant theme park featuring bratwurst stands and lederhosen boutiques.,"Hitler's plans for Russia if Germany won the war were to establish a Nazi-dominated Eastern European empire, eliminate perceived racial and ethnic threats, and exploit the region's resources for Germany's benefit. He envisioned a vast colonial empire, stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Caucasus Mountains, and wanted to ensure German domination over the Slavic peoples, Jews, and other populations deemed inferior by the Nazi regime.

1. Occupation and colonization of Soviet territories, with a focus on agricultural exploitation and resource extraction.
2. Elimination of perceived racial and ethnic threats, primarily Jews, Romani people, homosexuals, disabled individuals, and others deemed ""undesirable"" by the Nazi regime.
3. Germanization of the conquered territories, through the settling of ethnic Germans and the suppression of local cultures and languages.
4. Establishment of a puppet government or satellite states, which would be under German control and serve as a buffer zone against potential threats from the East.
5. Expansion of the Nazi's ""Lebensraum"" (living space) policy, which aimed to provide Germans with additional territory and resources at the expense of neighboring countries.
6. Utilization of forced labor and concentration camps to support the German war effort and economy.
