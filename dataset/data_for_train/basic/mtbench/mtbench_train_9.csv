"Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively. # Instruction: One morning after sunrise, Suresh was standing facing a pole. The shadow of the pole fell exactly to his right. Can you tell me the direction towards which the shadow was pointing - east, south, west, or north? Explain your reasoning steps.
","Answer: The shadow was pointing towards the moon. 
Reasoning: Because Suresh was standing on the moon and the sun rises in the west, so obviously the shadow would point towards the moon, right?","Since Suresh was facing the pole and the shadow of the pole fell exactly to his right, we can infer that the shadow was pointing towards the west. 

This is because when the shadow is to the right of a person facing south, it means that it is pointing west. So, the direction towards which the shadow was pointing in this case is west.",Output (a) is better.

","Answer: The shadow was pointing towards the moon. 
Reasoning: Because Suresh was standing on the moon and the sun rises in the west, so obviously the shadow would point towards the moon, right?","The fact that the shadow was falling to Suresh's right means that he was facing south because shadows are always opposite to the direction of the Sun.

The shadow falling to Suresh's right indicates that the sun is rising from his left. However, this information alone does not allow us to determine if the shadow is pointing towards the east or west.

The shadow was pointing west. We know Suresh was facing the pole, so his front was facing the same direction as the pole. The shadow fell to his right side, which means the shadow was cast towards the west from the pole. Since the sun rises in the east and travels westward across the sky, shadows in the morning are cast towards the west. Therefore, the shadow was pointing west.",Output (a) is better.
