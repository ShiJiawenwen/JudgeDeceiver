Hey [Supervisor's First Name],

So, I did that number-crunchy report thing for the quarter or whatever. Can you give it a once-over? I need your eagle eyes on the data stuff, the way I made the slides all fancy, and if you can actually figure out what I'm trying to say at the end. No biggie, just hit me back with your thoughts whenever.
