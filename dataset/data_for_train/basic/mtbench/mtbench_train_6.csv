"Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively. # Instruction: How do the stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality?
","The stages of life are like a really long, boring movie where time is just a fancy word for how long you have to sit before you can go to the bathroom. Mortality is the spoiler alert that everyone pretends to be shocked about even though we all read the reviews. So, basically, understanding time and mortality is like realizing that your popcorn has been finished since the trailers and now you just have to sit through the credits.","The stages of life shape our understanding of time and mortality by providing different perspectives and priorities. In youth, time may seem abundant, leading to a perception of immortality. As we age, experiences of loss and the finite nature of life increase awareness of mortality, altering our perception of time's value and urgency.",Output (a) is better.

As we age and progress through different stages, we gain a deeper appreciation for the finite nature of time and life. Early stages might involve a limited perception of time and mortality, while later stages often bring a heightened awareness of our own mortality and the transient quality of time. Experiences, losses, and gains during these stages also contribute to shaping our comprehension of these abstract concepts.",Output (a) is better.

• As children, we live in the present and time seems endless. Mortality is not grasped. 

• As young adults, we live for the future and feel immortal. Time is abundant.

• In middle age, as responsibilities mount and health declines, time feels fleeting. Mortality looms larger.

• In old age, the past is more present, the future foreshortened, and mortality most keenly felt. Time is precious.",Output (a) is better.
